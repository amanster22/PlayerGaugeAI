In just three years, Brunson has moved himself onto the short list of the best players ever to wear the blue and orange. That also included leading the Knicks to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years and to a third straight year with at least one playoff series victory, which hadn't happened since the glory days of the 1990s and early 2000s. The only acceptable outcome for Brunson and the Knicks this season, though, is to fully break through and reach the NBA Finals for the first time this century. Biggest question: How will Brunson adjust to new head coach Mike Brown? For the past three years, Brunson's meteoric ascent to superstardom in New York has been associated with Tom Thibodeau, with whom there was a clear bond of trust and admiration. Thibodeau has had a long run of success with building offenses around small guards and Brunson took the chance to become the leader of his own team with the Knicks and ran with it. Brunson is a tremendous player, of course, and will remain a focal point of the Knicks' offense. However, Brown has talked about both playing much faster and incorporating more ball movement into his offense in New York, much like he did with Sacramento the past few seasons. Brunson, on the other hand, has seemed to prefer playing at a slower pace, and the ball has constantly been in his hands under Thibodeau. It will be interesting to see how this relationship manifests itself over the coming months. But make no mistake: Brunson is still the straw that stirs the drink in Gotham, and he, more than anyone else, will be the one to determine whether the Knicks can break their 26-year Finals drought next spring. -- Tim Bontemps Signature stat: Brunson averaged a career-high 7.3 assists last season.

Even as he's about to turn 37, Durant remains an efficient and elite scorer who brings championship experience and IQ to go with a relentless work ethic, which is sure to rub off on Houston's relatively young roster. Biggest question: Does Durant's arrival make the Rockets legitimate contenders? Yes, but only if Houston's supporting cast does its part in helping Durant find his fit within the group. Having worked with Durant during his tenure in Brooklyn, Rockets head coach Ime Udoka knows the 15-time All-Star isn't the type of player who wants teammates to defer to him unnecessarily. Durant wants to be integrated into the group naturally, which in turn diversifies Houston's options for attacking opponents. So, the best way to maximize Durant's potential impact is continued growth from players such as Amen Thompson, Reed Sheppard, Jabari Smith Jr. and Alperen Sengun, who spent a good chunk of the summer in Istanbul, Turkey, working with Rockets developmental staffers on whittling down his post moves to focus on what's most effective. Durant has already told teammates to be themselves, and he'll find a way to fit in that best helps the team. Durant's vast experience in a variety of systems over the years ensures he'll find his way; it's just a matter of how quickly. -- Michael C.

He has already shown unprecedented late-career production and will become the first player ever to play 23 seasons when he steps on the floor this fall. His NBA Rank prominence is unprecedented, too: fellow all-time great Kobe Bryant fell to No. 93 at the start of his 20th and final season in 2015-16. Biggest question: Is this the last we see of James in a Lakers uniform? While James has built his career following a personal ethos to \"become comfortable being uncomfortable,\" the tension between James and the Lakers ratcheted up to another level this summer when his agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, told ESPN's Shams Charania, \"We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career,\" after the four-time MVP opted into his $52.6 million contract for next season. The statement opened the door for a wave of speculation about whether James wanted to be in L.A., despite the contract decision -- teams such as Dallas, Cleveland and New York were tossed around as potential trade destinations. Paul clarified to ESPN that he never addressed a trade with the Lakers on James' behalf and since the 40-year-old veteran has a no-trade clause in his contract, it would require his side to initiate the dialogue. The rhetoric has died down in the months since as James posted about crack-of-dawn workouts and cheering on Luka Doncic at EuroBasket on his Instagram account. James enters into an unprecedented NBA season with Doncic there to pass the Lakers torch to; his son, Bronny, as his teammate to relish the time with; and four titles and 40,000 points already on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.

So he still possesses the perimeter power that has made him one of the greats in the sport's long history. He will bend coverages and be the center of every defensive game plan when he is on the floor this season. The Warriors' success also remains tied to him. When he was on the floor last season, they outscored opponents by a team-best 299 points. When he was off the floor, they were outscored by a team-high 28 points. With him, they eliminated the 52-win Rockets in the first round and took a 1-0 lead on the Timberwolves in the semis. After he injured his hamstring in Game 1 and sat out, the Warriors lost four consecutive games and were eliminated. Biggest question: What is a potential concern for the 16-season veteran? The hamstring strain was Curry's first soft tissue injury since an adductor strain in November 2018. After healing relatively quickly, Curry even thought he could return for Game 6 of the series, had it been extended that long. He competed in a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe two months later and reported his body feeling 100 percent. He is known for having a disciplined workout routine and an obsession with keeping his body in shape for the season.

Edwards saw firsthand how Oklahoma City was a better team, with more depth, skill and tactics that were able to take him out of games. To ascend to the heights predicted for him since his star turn with USA Basketball in 2023, Edwards will need to diversify his offensive game and elevate his teammates. Biggest question: Will his penchant for getting technical fouls and being fined by the NBA continue? Edwards led the league with 18 technical fouls last season and was fined over $400,000 by the NBA for a variety of behaviors: obscene gestures, explicit language, and failing to leave the court after an ejection.

But even the Thunder will tell you that Jokic had some otherworldly games in that series, and they were fortunate to advance out of that fight of a second-round series. Simply put, Jokic is at the peak of his basketball powers right now and should be regarded as an MVP favorite as long as he stays at this level. Last season, Jokic became the third player in history to average a triple-double (29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists) for the season and had the fourth-highest player efficiency rating (32.04) in league history. He finished as the runner-up to Gilgeous-Alexander largely because the Thunder were so much better as a team than the dysfunctional Nuggets, who fired their coach and general manager at the end of the regular season and underachieved with a fourth-place Western Conference finish. Biggest question: Have the Nuggets done enough to build out the depth issues that plagued them last season? Part of the reason Jokic's numbers were so incredible is that the Nuggets needed him to carry such a heavy load after a second straight offseason of losing key players from their championship team.
